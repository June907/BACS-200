            If you ever played hard core games like Dark Souls, BloodBorn, Sekiro. You probably familiar with this guy, Hidetaka Miyazaki. The main video game director for Dark souls, BloodBorn and Sekiro.

            The biggest reason that Hidetaka Miyazaki is my inspration for game design is that he is pretty unique comes with games design compare with other game desingers.

            Unlike other video games stroy telling, Hidetaka like to tear story apart into pieces, stroy telling are mostly from items descrptions instead of people telling.
            He like to give changlle to players, unlike the mainstreams games in the 2015 to 2018, most of games like "Assassin's creed, with a low diffculties and tons of collectalbe items to have players put more times in their games. However, how dark souls designs was totally differents with those game, dark soul has a fair diffculties, and the epic boss fight, instead of having players put more time into collect those collectable items, dark souls is more focus on have players to put some effort in how to defeat bosses, which after you defeating a undefeatable bosses, it will comes will great stratification.
            Indeed, Hidetaka like to make game very diffcult for plays, but it does not kill players' passion on his games, players love to spend time on his game, to figure out his games' story, or how to defeat certain bosses. In Youtube, a BloodBorn story explain has over millions of views, which mean Hidetaka's games are sucessful.
