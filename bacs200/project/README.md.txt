Hi, I'm Junwen, I am a beginner in HTML and CSS. This webpage is for my final project in BACS-495 class.

I built this webpage from scratch instead of using bootstrap, although using bootstrap will probably make the progressed much faster, as I mentioned before, I’m just a beginner in HTML and CSS, so I like to explore what is out there.

If you are a gamer like me, you probably found my webpage has some alike layout with IGN.com and GameSpot.com. Since I’m trying to copy their page layout as my webpage models. I have redone my pages twice because I was having trouble moving my elements around, and of course, my webpage isn’t as good as those well-know gamer websites, like I said I’m just a beginner try to learn things, I will do more changes on this webpage in the future.

For my final project reviews group, I have complete all the Milestone requirements, I have more than 5 menus pages as you can tell from my banner. I also have the five fancy tricks which including “menus, slideshow”, “fade text animation”, “image switch animation” and “image gallery”.

Honestly, I learned quite a lot from this final project, from youtube, W3school, etc, I have watched the YouTuber “mmtuts” a lot to learn things quickly. He is really helpful throughout my final project.
